notes

products.html
			// add clause to disable mobile pagination buttons for firstPage and lastPage
	- maybe add two pagination number scrolll things, top and bottom

responsive
			// sort out layout for products.html; categories
			// navigation bar
			// basket columns need an xs-col attribute so it shrinks on smaller screens
			// z-index for search bar
			// :: problem was the col-xs not z-index

			// - productItems page
			//cart page

general
			//- add footer
	x social media buttons at the bototm

	x maybe add more fields in the "All Products" dropdown
	x	+ this would also be useful in the mobile view as then you wouldn't need the "Categories" section
	x	  since you would be able to view the categories in the dropdown

	- fix header logo thing
			// fancify the homepage

features
	x maybe add delivery + returns information page
			//accounts
			//favourites section

publications
	x markup which publications i'm using coz it's a freaking mess right now :D
